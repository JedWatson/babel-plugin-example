# babel-plugin-example

Bob **hates** function declarations with a passion (nobody knows why). Bob loves to enforce this on his
coworkers, he's snuck this plugin into their build system to force his tyrannical code style.

## Usage

```sh
$ npm install babel babel-plugin-example
$ babel --plugins babel-plugin-example script.js
```

# PS.

Please don't be like Bob.
